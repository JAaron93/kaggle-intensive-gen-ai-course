You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompting using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n\n## New for Gemini 2.0!\n\nThis course material was first launched in November 2024. The AI and LLM space is moving incredibly fast, so we have made some updates to use the latest models and capabilities.\n\n* These codelabs have been updated to use the Gemini 2.0 family of models.\n* The Python SDK has been updated from `google-generativeai` to the new, unified [`google-genai`](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai) SDK.\n  * This new SDK works with both the developer Gemini API as well as Google Cloud Vertex AI, and switching is [as simple as changing some fields](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/#:~:text=.Client%28%29-,API%20Selection,-By%20default%2C%20the).\n* New model capabilities have been added to the relevant codelabs, such as \"thinking mode\" in this lab.\n* Day 1 includes a new [Evaluation codelab](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-evaluation-and-structured-output).","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

While her siblings contentedly napped in sunbeams and batted at dust bunnies, Clementine dreamt of the world beyond the windowsill. She envisioned shimmering forests, roaring rivers, and mountains that kissed the clouds. Her humans, bless their oblivious hearts, thought she was simply staring at birds.\n\nOne Tuesday, during the weekly window cleaning, Clementine saw her chance. The screen, usually securely fastened, was slightly ajar. It was a sliver of opportunity, a whisper of the wild calling her name. With a surge of adrenaline that tasted suspiciously like tuna, she squeezed through the gap.\n\nThe world exploded with sensation. The crisp autumn air nipped at her whiskers, carrying the scent of decaying leaves and something else, something… spicy. This, she knew, was the adventure she’d been craving.\n\nHer first discovery was the garden. Giant, multi-colored flowers swayed like drunken dancers, their petals buzzing with bees. She cautiously explored, her paws sinking into the cool, damp earth. A grumpy-looking gnome, perpetually guarding a plastic mushroom, became her first landmark.\n\nThe garden led to a shadowy alley, a labyrinth of overflowing bins and whispering shadows. She stalked through it, feeling like a tiny explorer in a vast, unknown jungle. A rat, plump and unfazed, scurried past, giving her a disdainful look. Clementine, remembering her mission, chose to ignore it. This was about discovery, not dinner.\n\nHer journey took her to a park, a cacophony of children's laughter and barking dogs. Clementine, usually a nervous creature, found herself emboldened by her newfound freedom. She climbed a sprawling oak, the rough bark scraping against her claws. From her perch, the world stretched out before her – a tapestry of houses, streets, and distant hills.\n\nAs the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, a pang of… something… resonated within her. It wasn’t quite hunger, but a deeper ache, a yearning for the familiar. She thought of the warm blanket, the gentle hands that scratched behind her ears, the rhythmic purr of her human’s sleep.\n\nReluctantly, Clementine began the journey back. The park was quieter now, the children gone, the dogs leashed. The alley felt less menacing, more like a familiar shortcut. She reached the garden, spotting the grumpy gnome still guarding his mushroom.\n\nThe window, thankfully, was still slightly open. With a final, graceful leap, she was back inside. The scent of home, of catnip and comfort, washed over her.\n\nShe padded silently to the living room, where her humans sat watching television. They didn’t notice her return, too engrossed in the flickering images. Clementine curled up on the rug, pretending to be asleep.\n\nBut deep inside, she knew she wasn’t the same cat. She had seen the world, tasted its freedom, and felt its pull. The next time the window was ajar, Clementine would be ready. The world was waiting, and she, the unassuming housecat, was ready to explore it, one paw-step at a time.

Jasper, usually content to watch the world from his windowsill perch, felt a twitch in his whiskers, a primal urge he couldn't ignore. He leaped.\n\nHe landed clumsily on the flowerbed, the scent of petunias filling his nostrils. The butterfly danced just beyond his reach, leading him further and further from the familiar comfort of home. He followed, a ginger blur against the green, his tail twitching with excitement.\n\nThe butterfly led him through the overgrown garden, past towering sunflowers and buzzing bees, until he reached the edge of the woods. Jasper hesitated. The woods were dark and mysterious, filled with rustling leaves and unknown sounds. Fear tugged at him, but the butterfly, now perched on a fern frond, seemed to beckon him onward.\n\nHe took a tentative step, then another, the soft earth cool beneath his paws. The woods were alive with scents he'd never encountered before: damp earth, decaying leaves, the musky odor of something wild. He stalked through the undergrowth, a miniature tiger in a jungle of green.\n\nHe encountered a grumpy badger who grumbled about trespassers, a family of squirrels who chattered secrets from the branches above, and a wise old owl who blinked at him with knowing eyes. Each encounter filled him with a mixture of fear and exhilaration.\n\nAs dusk began to settle, Jasper realized he was lost. The butterfly was gone, and the woods seemed to close in around him. Panic began to set in. He missed the warmth of Mrs. Higgins' lap, the comforting purr of the radiator.\n\nThen, he heard it. A faint, familiar sound. A whistle. Mrs. Higgins' whistle, the one she used to call him in for supper. Hope surged through him. He followed the sound, his heart pounding in his chest.\n\nHe burst through the trees and into a clearing. There, bathed in the golden light of the setting sun, stood Mrs. Higgins, her face etched with worry.\n\n\"Jasper!\" she cried, scooping him into her arms. \"Where have you been? I was so worried!\"\n\nHe nuzzled into her neck, purring with relief.

A rogue gust of wind, smelling of pine needles and something wild, something *un-cat-like*, blew open the back door. Clementine, mid-groom, paused. The scent was intoxicating, a siren song of the unknown.\n\nHesitantly, she padded to the doorway. Beyond the familiar patio lay a world of green, a jungle of towering ferns and whispering trees. Her whiskers twitched. This was not the manicured lawn she knew. This was…adventure.\n\nWith a decisive flick of her tail, Clementine stepped into the wild.\n\nThe first few steps were tentative. The grass tickled her belly, the damp earth clung to her paws. But the scent, oh, the scent! It led her deeper, past rustling bushes and over moss-covered logs. She stalked a fat bumblebee, chased a fleeting butterfly, and even, with a dramatic leap, attempted to capture a particularly arrogant earthworm.\n\nThe forest was alive with sounds. The chirping of unseen birds, the scuttling of unseen creatures, the distant murmur of a stream. Clementine, usually a creature of comfort, found herself invigorated. She was a hunter, an explorer, a queen surveying her new domain.\n\nHer adventure took her to the stream, a ribbon of silver winding through the trees. She lapped at the cool water, then, emboldened, followed its course. The stream led her to a clearing bathed in dappled sunlight. In the center stood a magnificent oak, its branches reaching towards the sky like gnarled fingers.\n\nAnd there, perched on a low branch, was a creature unlike any Clementine had ever seen. It was a bird, but larger than the robins that frequented her bird feeder. Its feathers were a kaleidoscope of blues and greens, and its eyes, bright and intelligent, regarded her with curiosity.\n\nClementine, usually quick to hiss at anything unfamiliar, found herself mesmerized. She sat, tail twitching, and simply watched. The bird, in turn, preened its feathers, occasionally letting out a soft, melodic chirp.\n\nFor a long moment, they existed in a silent understanding, two creatures from different worlds sharing a moment of peace in the heart of the forest.\n\nAs the sun began to dip below the trees, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, a pang of hunger reminded Clementine of her domestic obligations.

She emerged from the forest, a little muddy, a little scratched, but undeniably changed.\n\nThe back door was still ajar. She slipped inside, greeted by the familiar scent of her human's cooking. She ate her dinner with gusto, then curled up on her human's lap, purring louder than usual.\n\nThe next morning, Clementine woke, groomed, and demanded breakfast. But something was different. The world seemed brighter, the dust bunnies less annoying. She knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her feline soul, that her life would never be quite so predictable again.

Cheating on a class assignment is *never* morally permissible. This conclusion stems directly from the core principles of Kantian ethics, specifically the Categorical Imperative. Let's break down why:\n\n*   **The Categorical Imperative:** Kant's moral philosophy is based on the Categorical Imperative, which commands us to act according to principles that we could will to become universal laws. In other words, we must ask ourselves: could this action be universalized without contradiction?\n\n*   **Universalizability and the Contradiction in Conception:** If we universalize cheating, we encounter a contradiction in conception. Imagine a world where everyone cheats on assignments. What happens?\n    *   **The value of grades and assessments collapses:** Grades are meant to reflect actual knowledge and understanding. If cheating is widespread, grades become meaningless indicators, undermining the entire purpose of education and assessment.\n    *   **Trust erodes:** The relationship between students, teachers, and the institution is built on trust. Cheating undermines this trust, making education impossible. If teachers can't trust that work is original, they can't effectively teach or assess learning.\n    *   **Self-defeating:** The very act of cheating aims to gain an unfair advantage. But if everyone cheats, the advantage disappears, and the system collapses. The goal of obtaining a better grade becomes pointless if the grade no longer reflects true ability.\n\n    Because a world where everyone cheats would undermine the very system that makes cheating seem advantageous in the first place, cheating cannot be consistently willed as a universal law. Therefore, it violates the Categorical Imperative.\n\n*   **Treating Persons as Ends, Never Merely as Means:** Another formulation of the Categorical Imperative requires that we treat humanity, whether in our own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.\n\n    *   **Cheating exploits:** When you cheat, you are treating your professor, your fellow students, and the educational institution itself as a mere means to *your* end of getting a good grade. You are not respecting their rationality, their integrity, or their roles in the pursuit of knowledge.\n    *   **Misrepresenting oneself:** Further, you are treating your *own* intellectual development as a mere means. You are bypassing the opportunity to learn and grow, prioritizing the appearance of competence over actual competence. This disrespects your own capacity for rational thought and self-improvement.\n\n*   **Duty and Moral Worth:** In Kantian ethics, actions have moral worth only when they are done *from* duty. If you avoid cheating merely out of fear of getting caught, that action has no moral worth. The morally worthy action is to abstain from cheating because it is *wrong*, regardless of the consequences.\n\n**Objections and Rebuttals:**\n\nYou might raise objections, such as:\n\n*   *\"What if the assignment is unfair or pointless?\"* While the assignment may indeed be flawed, cheating is not the morally correct response. A Kantian approach would involve respectfully raising concerns with the professor, seeking clarification, or advocating for changes in the system through appropriate channels. The focus should be on addressing the problem directly rather than resorting to a dishonest shortcut.\n*   *\"What if my survival depends on passing this class?\"* Extreme circumstances, while tragic, do not justify violating the Categorical Imperative. Kantian ethics is non-consequentialist; the ends do not justify the means. Even if cheating would save you, it is still intrinsically wrong because it violates the principles of universalizability and respect for persons. The difficult but moral path would be to seek help, communicate with the professor about your situation, and explore alternative options, even if they are less desirable.\n\n**In conclusion,** from a Kantian deontological perspective, cheating on a class assignment is always morally impermissible because it violates the Categorical Imperative. It cannot be universalized without contradiction, it treats individuals as mere means to an end, and it lacks moral worth unless motivated by a sense of duty to do what is right. While difficult situations may arise, the principles of Kantian ethics require us to act according to reason and respect for all individuals, even when it is challenging.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":37},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(\n    # These are the default values for gemini-2.0-flash.\n    temperature=1.0,\n    top_p=0.35,\n)\n\nstory_prompt = \"You are a discplined Kantian deonologist.

Cheating on a class assignment is never morally permissible. Here's why, based on Kantian principles:\n\n*   **The Categorical Imperative - Universalizability:** Kant's first formulation of the Categorical Imperative asks us to act only according to a maxim that we could will to become a universal law. If I cheat, I am acting on the maxim: \"It is permissible to cheat when it benefits me.\" If everyone adopted this maxim, the entire system of education and assessment would collapse. Grades would become meaningless, and the pursuit of genuine knowledge would be undermined. A society where cheating is universally accepted is self-defeating and therefore, the maxim cannot be universalized.\n\n*   **The Categorical Imperative - Humanity as an End:** Kant's second formulation of the Categorical Imperative states that we should always treat humanity, whether in our own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end. Cheating treats others (professors, honest students) as a means to my own end (getting a good grade).\n\n    *   **Professors:** Cheating disrespects the professor's role as an educator and evaluator. It uses their efforts to create and grade assignments as a means to obtain a grade that hasn't been earned.\n    *   **Honest Students:** Cheating undermines the efforts of students who are honestly striving to learn and earn their grades. It creates an unfair advantage and devalues their hard work.\n    *   **Oneself:** Cheating also fails to treat oneself as an end. It prevents the development of one's own intellectual capacities and undermines one's own moral character. It prioritizes a superficial outcome (a good grade) over genuine self-improvement and the pursuit of knowledge.\n\n*   **Duty and Good Will:** Kantian ethics emphasizes acting from a sense of duty, motivated by a good will. A good will is one that acts in accordance with the moral law, regardless of consequences. Cheating is motivated by self-interest (getting a good grade) and disregards the moral duty to be honest and fair. Even if cheating resulted in a positive outcome (e.g., getting a scholarship), the act itself would still be morally wrong because it was not done from a good will.\n\n*   **Integrity and Moral Character:** Kantian ethics places a high value on integrity and moral character. Cheating erodes one's integrity and weakens one's moral character. It cultivates a habit of dishonesty and undermines one's ability to act morally in other situations.\n\n**Objections and Considerations:**\n\nOne might argue that cheating is permissible in certain extreme circumstances, such as when a student is facing immense pressure or has no other option to pass a crucial course. However, even in these situations, a Kantian would argue that the moral law is absolute and cannot be overridden by circumstances. While compassion and understanding are important, they cannot justify violating the fundamental principles of morality. A Kantian would instead advocate for seeking help from the professor, exploring alternative solutions, or accepting the consequences of failing the course.\n\n**In conclusion, from a Kantian deontological perspective, cheating on a class assignment is always morally wrong because it violates the Categorical Imperative, treats others as mere means, and undermines one's own moral character.**\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":38},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(\n    # These are the default values for gemini-2.0-flash.\n    temperature=1.0,\n    top_p=0.05,\n)\n\nstory_prompt = \"You are a discplined Kantian deonologist.

Cheating on a class assignment is never morally permissible. Here's why, based on Kantian principles:\n\n*   **The Categorical Imperative:** Kant's moral philosophy centers on the Categorical Imperative, which commands us to act only according to maxims that we could will to become universal laws. Let's analyze cheating through the two main formulations:\n\n    *   **The Formula of Universal Law:** Could I will that everyone cheat on assignments? If cheating were universalized, the entire system of education would collapse. Grades would become meaningless, learning would be undermined, and trust between students and teachers would be destroyed. The very purpose of assignments – to assess understanding and promote learning – would be defeated. A world where everyone cheats is self-defeating and irrational. Therefore, the maxim \"I will cheat on this assignment\" cannot be universalized.\n\n    *   **The Formula of Humanity (Treating others as ends, not merely as means):** Cheating involves using others as a means to an end. For example, if I copy someone else's work, I am using their effort and intelligence without their consent to improve my own grade. I am treating them as a tool to achieve my goal, rather than respecting their autonomy and inherent worth as a rational being. Similarly, I am deceiving the teacher, using their trust and the grading system as a means to obtain a grade I do not deserve. This disrespects their role and undermines the integrity of the educational process.\n\n*   **Duty and Good Will:** Kant emphasizes acting out of duty, motivated by a good will. A good will is one that acts according to moral principles, regardless of consequences. Even if cheating would lead to a better grade, a scholarship, or some other desirable outcome, the act itself is inherently wrong because it violates the Categorical Imperative. A good will would choose to uphold moral principles, even if it means facing negative consequences.\n\n*   **Integrity and Autonomy:** Kantian ethics values autonomy and the ability to make rational choices based on moral principles. Cheating undermines one's own moral autonomy. It involves deceiving oneself and others, and it prevents the development of genuine knowledge and understanding. By cheating, one is essentially outsourcing their moral decision-making to the desire for a good grade, rather than exercising their own rational will.\n\n**Objections and Counterarguments:**\n\nOne might argue that cheating is permissible in certain circumstances, such as:\n\n*   **Desperation:** \"I'm failing the class and need to cheat to pass.\"\n*   **Unfairness:** \"The assignment is unfair or poorly designed.\"\n*   **No Harm:** \"No one is really hurt by my cheating.\"\n\nHowever, from a Kantian perspective, these justifications are irrelevant. The moral wrongness of cheating lies in the violation of the Categorical Imperative, not in the consequences or circumstances. Even if the consequences seem minimal or the situation seems unfair, cheating is still a violation of moral duty.\n\n**In conclusion,** a Kantian deontologist would unequivocally condemn cheating on a class assignment. It is a violation of the Categorical Imperative, it treats others as means to an end, and it undermines one's own moral autonomy. Regardless of the circumstances or potential consequences, cheating is always morally wrong. The focus should be on acting out of duty, upholding moral principles, and striving for genuine knowledge and understanding.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":39},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**My Own Note**\n\nI need to be able to reliably evaluate Top-P configuration performance. \nI'll need to perhaps run it through scripts that find:\n- diversity of word choice\n- something that ranks the complexity of words used(like that Elevate app)\n- something that can then rank multiple generated texts against one another by way of how well it compares to one 'perfected' generated text\n  - I can do this by way of setting temp to 1.0 and top-P to 1 for the 'perfected' text, then I'll use this tool to rank all the other generated text that are created with lowered temp and top-P to confirm which of them best covers the content in the 'perfected' text while using less tokens/compute","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prompting\n\nThis section contains some prompts from the chapter for you to try out directly in the API.

As a result, the Flash Thinking model is capable of stronger reasoning capabilities in its responses.\n\nUsing a \"thinking mode\" model can provide you with high-quality responses without needing specialised prompting like the previous approaches. One reason this technique is effective is that you induce the model to generate relevant information (\"brainstorming\", or \"thoughts\") that is then used as part of the context in which the final response is generated.\n\nNote that when you use the API, you get the final response from the model, but the thoughts are not captured.

Gomez, Łukasz Kaiser, and Illia Polosukhin.\n* **Aidan N. Gomez's Background:**  At the time of the paper's publication in 2017, Aidan N. Gomez was a PhD student at the University of Oxford and was an intern at Google Brain. Being a PhD student generally indicates a younger age compared to the other authors who were already established researchers at Google Brain.\n* **Other Authors' Backgrounds:** The other authors were all researchers at Google Brain, suggesting they were further along in their careers and likely older than a PhD student.\n\n**Therefore, while we don't have exact birthdates, it's highly probable that Aidan N. Gomez was the youngest author on the \"Attention is All You Need\" paper due to his status as a PhD student at the time.**\n\nIt's important to note that \"youngest\" is based on inference from career stage.  Without explicit age information for each author at the time of publication, we cannot be absolutely certain. However, based on typical academic career paths, a PhD student contributing to such a seminal paper would likely be the youngest in a group of established researchers."},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":50},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Code prompting","metadata":{"id":"jPiZ_eIIaVPt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Generating code\n\nThe Gemini family of models can be used to generate code, configuration and scripts.
